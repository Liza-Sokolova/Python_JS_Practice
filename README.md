# Python_JS_Practice
This is my practice with Python and JavaScript following a YouTube Tutorial. 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PppslXOR7TA 
- Tutorial is meant to create a web application from scratch using Python with Flask backend, and JavaScript with React frontend. 
I am initially following the tutorial to get more familiar with how JS interacts with Python and Flask, and will improve upon the tutorial creation later. 

## Files / Folders

1. backend/main.py 
2. backend/models.py
    Creates the model of the database objects. How a contact is stored, it's fields and types. 
3. backend/config.py
    Creates/Sets the app configurations and imports, such as Flask or SQLAlchemy.
